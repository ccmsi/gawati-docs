Code Deployment and Build
#########################

Introduction
************

Once you have completed the :doc:`setup essentials <setup-essentials>`_, you will
need to deploy the code from github into the system. The steps below describe the complete
installation process and the tools. Note that - if your intention is just develop / contribute
on a particular module, you **don't need** to do these following steps, you can as well clone
the specific repositories and contribute to Gawati, see :doc:`<dev-env.rst>`_ for more on how to
do this.
