Setting Up Gawati
#################

Introduction
************

The setup is split into two parts. 

* The first (:doc:`setup-essentials`) installs the essential pre-requisites and components for Gawati. 
* The second (:doc:`setup-code`) builds and installs the source code of Gawati.

All these scripts have been tested on CentOS 7.
